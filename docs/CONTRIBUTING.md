# Contributing to this Project

Contributing to this project is quite simple. All you need to do is fork it and do a pull request. I've gone ahead and made a brief video covering the subject.
You can view that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqX4rFRLvzI).

When you make your pull request; ensure you describe your changes and the reasoning behind it. If your code does not match our import or organization methods it will **NOT** be merged.
